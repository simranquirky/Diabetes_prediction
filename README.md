# Web App Using Python - Live Project üë©üèª‚Äçüíª



üî∞The functionality/explanation of the app development is as below: 

‚ùáÔ∏è Have a UI that pulls data from an excel and then takes input from an app and consolidates all the data in another excel.

We have created a Diabetes prediction app

To run the app in your local system or cloud system the prerequisites are:

1. git software installed( yum install git -y)
This needs to be done so that you can copy the github code.

2. Python3 installed (yum install python3 -y)
The code is written in python language so without having python3 software installed, you won‚Äôt be able to run the app.

3. tensorflow module installed
As In our code we have imported tensorflow module.

After having all this software installed you can start by running following lines of code:

git clone https://github.com/simranquirky/LiveProject.git

cd /LiveProject

python3 app.py


Now you can open the given port in your browser to get the graphical view of the app and start predicting.
The opening or the home page of the app looks like:

Here one needs to fill the details in the form and proceed with the submit button to continue.
If the results are negative, i.e. if no symptoms of diabetes is encountered then you will be redirected to page ‚Äúhealthy.html‚Äù which appears as:
